Preface to the English Standard\nVersion\nThe Bible\n\u201cThis Book [is] the most valuable thing that this world\naffords. Here is Wisdom; this is the royal Law; these\nare the lively Oracles of God.\u201d With these words the\nModerator of the Church of Scotland hands a Bible\nto the new monarch in Britain\u2019s coronation service.", "These words echo the King James Bible translators,\nwho wrote in 1611: \u201cGod\u2019s sacred Word . . . is that\ninestimable treasure that excelleth all the riches of\nthe earth.\u201d This assessment of the Bible is the\nmotivating force behind the publication of the English\nStandard Version. Translation Legacy\nThe English Standard Version (ESV) stands in the\nclassic mainstream of English Bible translations\nover the past half-millennium.", "The fountainhead of\nthat stream was William Tyndale\u2019s New Testament\nof 1526; marking its course were the King James\nVersion of 1611 (KJV), the English Revised Version\nof 1885 (RV), the American Standard Version of\n1901 (ASV), and the Revised Standard Version of\n1952 and 1971 (RSV). In that stream, faithfulness to\nthe text and vigorous pursuit of accuracy were\ncombined with simplicity, beauty, and dignity of\nexpression. Our goal has been to carry forward this\nlegacy for a new century.", "To this end each word and phrase in the ESV has\nbeen carefully weighed against the original Hebrew,\nAramaic, and Greek, to ensure the fullest accuracy\nand clarity and to avoid under-translating or\noverlooking any nuance of the original text. The\nwords and phrases themselves grow out of the\nTyndale\u2013King James legacy, and most recently out\nof the RSV, with the 1971 RSV text providing the\nstarting point for our work.", "Archaic language has\nbeen brought to current usage and significant\ncorrections have been made in the translation of key\ntexts. But throughout, our goal has been to retain the\ndepth of meaning and enduring language that have\nmade their indelible mark on the English-speaking\nworld and have defined the life and doctrine of the\nchurch over the last four centuries.", "Translation Philosophy\nThe ESV is an \u201cessentially literal\u201d translation that\nseeks as far as possible to capture the precise\nwording of the original text and the personal style of\neach Bible writer. As such, its emphasis is on \u201cword-\nfor-word\u201d correspondence, at the same time taking\ninto account differences of grammar, syntax, and\nidiom between current literary English and the\noriginal languages.", "Thus it seeks to be transparent\nto the original text, letting the reader see as directly\nas possible the structure and meaning of the\noriginal. In contrast to the ESV, some Bible versions have\nfollowed a \u201cthought-for-thought\u201d rather than \u201cword-for-\nword\u201d translation philosophy, emphasizing \u201cdynamic\nequivalence\u201d rather than the \u201cessentially literal\u201d\nmeaning of the original.", "A \u201cthought-for-thought\u201d\ntranslation is of necessity more inclined to reflect the\ninterpretive opinions of the translator and the\ninfluences of contemporary culture. Every translation is at many points a trade-off\nbetween literal precision and readability, between\n\u201cformal equivalence\u201d in expression and \u201cfunctional\nequivalence\u201d in communication, and the ESV is no\nexception.", "Within this framework we have sought to\nbe \u201cas literal as possible\u201d while maintaining clarity of\nexpression and literary excellence. Therefore, to the\nextent that plain English permits and the meaning in\neach case allows, we have sought to use the same\nEnglish word for important recurring words in the\noriginal; and, as far as grammar and syntax allow,\nwe have rendered Old Testament passages cited in\nthe New in ways that show their correspondence.", "Thus in each of these areas, as well as throughout\nthe Bible as a whole, we have sought to capture the\nechoes and overtones of meaning that are so\nabundantly present in the original texts. As an essentially literal translation, then, the ESV\nseeks to carry over every possible nuance of\nmeaning in the original words of Scripture into our\nown language. As such, it is ideally suited for in-\ndepth study of the Bible.", "Indeed, with its emphasis\non literary excellence, the ESV is equally suited for\npublic reading and preaching, for private reading\nand reflection, for both academic and devotional\nstudy, and for Scripture memorization. Translation Style\nThe ESV also carries forward classic translation\nprinciples in its literary style.", "Accordingly it retains\ntheological terminology\u2014words such as grace, faith,\njustification, sanctification, redemption,\nregeneration, reconciliation, propitiation\u2014because\nof their central importance for Christian doctrine and\nalso because the underlying Greek words were\nalready becoming key words and technical terms in\nNew Testament times.", "The ESV lets the stylistic variety of the biblical\nwriters fully express itself\u2014from the exalted prose\nthat opens Genesis, to the flowing narratives of the\nhistorical books, to the rich metaphors and dramatic\nimagery of the poetic books, to the ringing rhetorical\nindictments in the prophetic books, to the smooth\nelegance of Luke, to the profound simplicities of\nJohn, and the closely reasoned logic of Paul.", "In punctuating, paragraphing, dividing long\nsentences, and rendering connectives, the ESV\nfollows the path that seems to make the ongoing flow\nof thought clearest in English. The biblical languages\nregularly connect sentences by frequent repetition of\nwords such as \u201cand,\u201d \u201cbut,\u201d and \u201cfor,\u201d in a way that\ngoes beyond the conventions of literary English.", "Effective translation, however, requires that these\nlinks in the original be reproduced so that the flow of\nthe argument will be transparent to the reader. We\nhave therefore normally translated these\nconnectives, though occasionally we have varied the\nrendering by using alternatives (such as \u201calso,\u201d\n\u201chowever,\u201d \u201cnow,\u201d \u201cso,\u201d \u201cthen,\u201d or \u201cthus\u201d) when they\nbetter capture the sense in specific instances.", "In the area of gender language, the goal of the ESV\nis to render literally what is in the original. For\nexample, \u201canyone\u201d replaces \u201cany man\u201d where there\nis no word corresponding to \u201cman\u201d in the original\nlanguages, and \u201cpeople\u201d rather than \u201cmen\u201d is\nregularly used where the original languages refer to\nboth men and women. But the words \u201cman\u201d and\n\u201cmen\u201d are retained where a male meaning\ncomponent is part of the original Greek or Hebrew.", "Likewise, the word \u201cman\u201d has been retained where\nthe original text intends to convey a clear contrast\nbetween \u201cGod\u201d on the one hand and \u201cman\u201d on the\nother hand, with \u201cman\u201d being used in the collective\nsense of the whole human race (see Luke 2:52). Similarly, the English word \u201cbrothers\u201d (translating the\nGreek word adelphoi) is retained as an important\nfamilial form of address between fellow-Jews and\nfellow-Christians in the first century.", "A recurring note\nis included to indicate that the term \u201cbrothers\u201d\n(adelphoi) was often used in Greek to refer to both\nmen and women, and to indicate the specific\ninstances in the text where this is the case. In\naddition, the English word \u201csons\u201d (translating the\nGreek word huioi) is retained in specific instances\nbecause the underlying Greek term usually includes\na male meaning component and it was used as a\nlegal term in the adoption and inheritance laws of\nfirst-century Rome.", "As used by the apostle Paul, this\nterm refers to the status of all Christians, both men\nand women, who, having been adopted into God\u2019s\nfamily, now enjoy all the privileges, obligations, and\ninheritance rights of God\u2019s children. The inclusive use of the generic \u201che\u201d has also\nregularly been retained, because this is consistent\nwith similar usage in the original languages and\nbecause an essentially literal translation would be\nimpossible without it.", "Similarly, where God and man\nare compared or contrasted in the original, the ESV\nretains the generic use of \u201cman\u201d as the clearest way\nto express the contrast within the framework of\nessentially literal translation. In each case the objective has been transparency to\nthe original text, allowing the reader to understand\nthe original on its own terms rather than on the terms\nof our present-day culture.", "The Translation of Specialized Terms\nIn the translation of biblical terms referring to God,\nthe ESV takes great care to convey the specific\nnuances of meaning of the original Hebrew and\nGreek terms. First, concerning terms that refer to\nGod in the Old Testament: God, the Maker of heaven\nand earth, introduced himself to the people of Israel\nwith the special, personal name, whose consonants\nare YHWH (see Exodus 3:14-15).", "Scholars call this\nthe \u201cTetragrammaton,\u201d a Greek term referring to the\nfour Hebrew letters YHWH. The exact pronunciation\nof YHWH is uncertain, because the Jewish people\nconsidered the personal name of God to be so holy\nthat it should never be spoken aloud. Instead of\nreading the word YHWH, they would normally read\nthe Hebrew word adonai (\u201cLord\u201d), and the ancient\ntranslations into Greek, Syriac, and Aramaic also\nfollowed suit.", "When the vowels of the word adonai\nare placed with the consonants of YHWH, this results\nin the familiar word Jehovah that was used in some\nearlier English Bible translations. As is common\namong English translations today, the ESV usually\nrenders the personal name of God (YHWH) with the\nword LORD (printed in small capitals). An exception\nto this is when the Hebrew word adonai appears\ntogether with YHWH, in which case the two words\nare rendered together as \u201cthe Lord", "[in lower case]\nGOD [in small capitals].\u201d In contrast to the personal\nname for God (YHWH), the more general name for\nGod in Old Testament Hebrew is \u2019elohim and its\nrelated forms of \u2019el or \u2019eloah, all of which are normally\ntranslated \u201cGod\u201d (in lower case letters).", "Although the term originally meant\n\u201canointed,\u201d among Jews in New Testament times the\nterm came to designate the Messiah, the great\nSavior that God had promised to raise up. In other\nNew Testament contexts, however, especially\namong Gentiles, Christos (\u201cChrist\u201d) was on its way to\nbecoming a proper name. It is important, therefore,\nto keep the context in mind in understanding the\nvarious ways that Christos (\u201cChrist\u201d) is used in the\nNew Testament.", "At the same time, in accord with its\n\u201cessentially literal\u201d translation philosophy, the ESV\nhas retained consistency and concordance in the\ntranslation of Christos (\u201cChrist\u201d) throughout the New\nTestament. A third specialized term, the word \u201cbehold,\u201d usually\nhas been retained as the most common translation\nfor the Hebrew word hinneh and the Greek word\nidou. Both of these words mean something like \u201cPay\ncareful attention to what follows! This is important!\u201d", "Other than the word \u201cbehold,\u201d there is no single word\nin English that fits well in most contexts. Although\n\u201cLook!\u201d and \u201cSee!\u201d and \u201cListen!\u201d would be workable\nin some contexts, in many others these words lack\nsufficient weight and dignity. Given the principles of\n\u201cessentially literal\u201d translation, it is important not to\nleave hinneh and idou completely untranslated, and\nso to lose the intended emphasis in the original\nlanguages.", "The older and more formal word \u201cbehold\u201d\nhas usually been retained, therefore, as the best\navailable option for conveying the original sense of\nmeaning. Textual Basis\nThe ESV is based on the Masoretic text of the\nHebrew Bible as found in Biblia Hebraica\nStuttgartensia (2nd ed., 1983), and on the Greek\ntext in the 1993 editions of the Greek New\nTestament (4th corrected ed.), published by the\nUnited Bible Societies (UBS), and Novum\nTestamentum Graece (27th ed.), edited by Nestle\nand Aland.", "The currently renewed respect among\nOld Testament scholars for the Masoretic text is\nreflected in the ESV\u2019s attempt, wherever possible, to\ntranslate difficult Hebrew passages as they stand in\nthe Masoretic text rather than resorting to\nemendations or to finding an alternative reading in\nthe ancient versions.", "In exceptional, difficult cases,\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls, the Septuagint, the Samaritan\nPentateuch, the Syriac Peshitta, the Latin Vulgate,\nand other sources were consulted to shed possible\nlight on the text, or, if necessary, to support a\ndivergence from the Masoretic text. Similarly, in a\nfew difficult cases in the New Testament, the ESV\nhas followed a Greek text different from the text\ngiven preference in the UBS/Nestle-Aland 27th\nedition.", "In this regard the footnotes that accompany\nthe ESV text are an integral part of the ESV\ntranslation, informing the reader of textual variations\nand difficulties and showing how these have been\nresolved by the ESV translation team. In addition to\nthis, the footnotes indicate significant alternative\nreadings and occasionally provide an explanation for\ntechnical terms or for a difficult reading in the text.", "Throughout, the translation team has benefited\ngreatly from the massive textual resources that have\nbecome readily available recently, from new insights\ninto biblical laws and culture, and from current\nadvances in Hebrew and Greek lexicography and\ngrammatical understanding. Publishing Team\nThe ESV publishing team includes more than a\nhundred people.", "The fourteen-member Translation\nOversight Committee has benefited from the work of\nfifty biblical experts serving as Translation Review\nScholars and from the comments of the more than\nfifty members of the Advisory Council, all of which\nhas been carried out under the auspices of the Good\nNews Publishers Board of Directors.", "This hundred-\nmember team, which shares a common commitment\nto the truth of God\u2019s Word and to historic Christian\northodoxy, is international in scope and includes\nleaders in many denominations. To God\u2019s Honor and Praise\nWe know that no Bible translation is perfect or final;\nbut we also know that God uses imperfect and\ninadequate things to his honor and praise.", "So to our\ntriune God and to his people we offer what we have\ndone, with our prayers that it may prove useful, with\ngratitude for much help given, and with ongoing\nwonder that our God should ever have entrusted to\nus so momentous a task. Soli Deo Gloria!\u2014To God alone be the glory!", "The Translation Oversight Committee*\n*A complete list of the Translation Oversight\nCommittee, the Translation Review Scholars, and\nthe Advisory Council, is available upon request from\nCrossway Bibles, a publishing ministry of Good\nNews Publishers. Explanation of Features Included\nin this Edition\nThis edition of the ESV Bible includes a number of\nvaluable features to encourage the reading and\nstudy of the Bible.", "A brief description is provided\nbelow explaining the purpose and use of this\nedition\u2019s features. Section Headings\nSection headings have been included throughout the\ntext of this edition. While the headings are not part of\nthe Bible text itself, they have been provided to help\nidentify and locate important themes and topics\nthroughout the Bible. Textual Footnotes\nSeveral kinds of footnotes related to the ESV text\nare provided throughout the ESV Bible to assist the\nreader.", "These footnotes appear at the bottom of the\npage and are indicated in the ESV text by a\nsuperscript number that follows the word or phrase\nto which the footnote applies (e.g., \u201cIsaac2\u201d). Superscript letters that precede a word are used to\nindicate cross-references (see explanation below). The footnotes included in the ESV Bible are an\nintegral part of the text and provide important\ninformation concerning the understanding and\ntranslation of the text.", "The footnotes fall mainly into\nfour categories, as illustrated in the examples below. Types of Footnotes\n1. Alternative Translations. Footnotes of this\nkind provide alternative translations for\nspecific words or phrases when there is a\nstrong possibility that such words or phrases\ncould be translated in another way, such as:\n\u201cOr keep awake\u201d (see Matt. 26:38); and \u201cOr\ndown payment\u201d (see Eph. 1:14).", "In such\ncases, the translation deemed to have the\nstronger support is in the text while other\npossible renderings are given in the note. 2. Explanation of Greek and Hebrew Terms. Notes of this kind relate primarily to the\nmeaning of specific Greek or Hebrew terms,\nas illustrated by the following examples:\n1. Notes about the meaning of names in the\noriginal languages, such as: \u201cIsaac\nmeans he laughs\u201d (see Gen. 17:19); and\n\u201cSimeon sounds like the Hebrew for\nheard\u201d (see Gen. 29:33).", "2. Notes that give the literal translation of a\nGreek or Hebrew word or phrase\ndeemed too awkward to be used in the\nEnglish text, such as: \u201cGreek girding up\nthe loins of your mind\u201d (see 1 Pet. 1:13). 3. Notes indicating that absolute certainty\nof the meaning of a word or phrase is not\npossible given our best understanding of\nthe original language (e.g., Hebrew\nwords occurring so infrequently in the Old\nTestament that their meaning cannot be\ndetermined with certainty).", "Such words\nare identified with a note stating that\n\u201cThe meaning of the Hebrew is\nuncertain\u201d (see, e.g., Josh. 17:11).", "4. Notes that indicate the specialized use\nof a Greek word, such as: \u201cbrothers,\u201d\ntranslating the Greek word adelphoi\n(see, e.g., the extended note on Rom.\n1:13, corresponding to the first\noccurrence of adelphoi in any New\nTestament book, and the abbreviated\nnote, e.g., on Rom. 7:1, corresponding to\nsubsequent occurrences of adelphoi in\nany New Testament book); and \u201csons,\u201d\ntranslating the Greek word huioi (see,\ne.g., Rom. 8:14). See also the\ndiscussion of adelphoi and huioi in the\npreface. 3.", "Other Explanatory Notes. Footnotes of this\nkind provide clarifying information as illustrated\nby the following examples:\n1. Notes clarifying additional meanings that\nmay not otherwise be apparent in the\ny\npp\ntext, such as: \u201cLeprosy was a term for\nseveral skin diseases; see Leviticus 13.\u201d\n2. Notes clarifying important grammatical\npoints that would not otherwise be\napparent in English, such as: \u201cIn Hebrew\nyou is plural in verses 1-5\u201d (see Gen.\n3:1). 3.", "Notes clarifying when the referent for a\npronoun has been supplied in the\nEnglish text, such as: \u201cGreek he\u201d (see,\ne.g., Mark 1:43). 4.

Will you destroy the whole city for lack of\nfive?\u201d And he said, \u201cI will not destroy it if I find forty-\nfive there.\u201d", "29Again he spoke to him and said,\n\u201cSuppose forty are found there.\u201d He answered, \u201cFor\nthe sake of forty I will not do it.\u201d 30Then he said, \u201cOh\nlet not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose\nthirty are found there.\u201d He answered, \u201cI will not do it, if\nI find thirty there.\u201d 31He said, \u201cBehold, I have\nundertaken to speak to the Lord.

Suppose ten are found there.\u201d He answered,\n\u201cFor the sake of ten I will not destroy it.\u201d 33And the\nLORD went his way, when he had finished speaking\nto Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place. God Rescues Lot\n19:1 The two angels came to Sodom in the\nevening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom.", "When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and\nbowed himself with his face to the earth 2and said,\n\u201cMy lords, please turn aside to your servant's house\nand spend the night and wash your feet. Then you\nmay rise up early and go on your way.\u201d They said,\n\u201cNo; we will spend the night in the town square.\u201d 3But\nhe pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to\nhim and entered his house. And he made them a\nfeast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.", "4But before they lay down, the men of the city, the\nmen of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to\nthe last man, surrounded the house. 5And they called\nto Lot, \u201cWhere are the men who came to you\ntonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know\nthem.\u201d 6Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut\nthe door after him, 7and said, \u201cI beg you, my\nbrothers, do not act so wickedly. 8Behold, I have two\ndaughters who have not known any man. Let me\nbring them out to you, and do to them as you please.", "Only do nothing to these men, for they have come\nunder the shelter of my roof.\u201d 9But they said, \u201cStand\nback!\u201d And they said, \u201cThis fellow came to sojourn,\nand he has become the judge! Now we will deal\nworse with you than with them.\u201d Then they pressed\nhard against the man Lot, and drew near to break\nthe door down. 10But the men reached out their\nhands and brought Lot into the house with them and\nshut the door.", "11And they struck with blindness the\nmen who were at the entrance of the house, both\nsmall and great, so that they wore themselves out\ngroping for the door. 12Then the men said to Lot, \u201cHave you anyone else\nhere? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you\nhave in the city, bring them out of the place. 13For we\nare about to destroy this place, because the outcry\nagainst its people has become great before the\nLORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.\u201d", "14So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who\nwere to marry his daughters, \u201cUp! Get out of this\nplace, for the LORD is about to destroy the city.\u201d But\nhe seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting. 15As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying,\n\u201cUp! Take your wife and your two daughters who are\nhere, lest you be swept away in the punishment of\nthe city.\u201d 16But he lingered.", "So the men seized him\nand his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the\nLORD being merciful to him, and they brought him\nout and set him outside the city. 17And as they\nbrought them out, one said, \u201cEscape for your life. Do\nnot look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape\nto the hills, lest you be swept away.\u201d 18And Lot said\nto them, \u201cOh, no, my lords. 19Behold, your servant\nhas found favor in your sight, and you have shown\nme great kindness in saving my life.", "God Destroys Sodom\n23The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to\nZoar. 24Then the LORD rained on Sodom and\nGomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of\nheaven. 25And he overthrew those cities, and all the\nvalley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what\ngrew on the ground. 26But Lot's wife, behind him,\nlooked back, and she became a pillar of salt. 27And Abraham went early in the morning to the\nplace where he had stood before the LORD.", "28And\nhe looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and\ntoward all the land of the valley, and he looked and,\nbehold, the smoke of the land went up like the\nsmoke of a furnace. 29So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of\nthe valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot\nout of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew\nthe cities in which Lot had lived. Lot and His Daughters\n30Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills\nwith his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in\nZoar.", "So he lived in a cave with his two daughters. 31And the firstborn said to the younger, \u201cOur father is\nold, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us\nafter the manner of all the earth. 32Come, let us\nmake our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,\nthat we may preserve offspring from our father.\u201d 33So\nthey made their father drink wine that night.

He did not\nknow when she lay down or when she arose.", "34The next day, the firstborn said to the younger,\n\u201cBehold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make\nhim drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie\nwith him, that we may preserve offspring from our\nfather.\u201d 35So they made their father drink wine that\nnight also. And the younger arose and lay with him,\nand he did not know when she lay down or when she\narose. 36Thus both the daughters of Lot became\npregnant by their father. 37The firstborn bore a son\nand called his name Moab.[86]", "He is the father of the\nMoabites to this day. 38The younger also bore a son\nand called his name Ben-ammi.[87] He is the father\nof the Ammonites to this day.

So he said, \u201cLord, will you kill an innocent\npeople? 5Did he not himself say to me, \u2018She is my\nsister\u2019? And she herself said, \u2018He is my brother.\u2019 In\nthe integrity of my heart and the innocence of my\nhands I have done this.\u201d", "6Then God said to him in the\ndream, \u201cYes, I know that you have done this in the\nintegrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from\nsinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch\nher. 7Now then, return the man's wife, for he is a\nprophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall\nlive. But if you do not return her, know that you shall\nsurely die, you and all who are yours.\u201d 8So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called\nall his servants and told them all these things.", "And\nthe men were very much afraid. 9Then Abimelech\ncalled Abraham and said to him, \u201cWhat have you\ndone to us? And how have I sinned against you, that\nyou have brought on me and my kingdom a great\nsin? You have done to me things that ought not to be\ndone.\u201d 10And Abimelech said to Abraham, \u201cWhat did\nyou see, that you did this thing?\u201d 11Abraham said, \u201cI\ndid it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all\nin this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.", "12Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of\nmy father though not the daughter of my mother, and\nshe became my wife. 13And when God caused me\nto wander from my father's house, I said to her, \u2018This\nis the kindness you must do me: at every place to\nwhich we come, say of me, He is my brother.\u2019\u201d\n14Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male\nservants and female servants, and gave them to\nAbraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him.", "15And\nAbimelech said, \u201cBehold, my land is before you;\ndwell where it pleases you.\u201d 16To Sarah he said,\n\u201cBehold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces\nof silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of\nall[88] who are with you, and before everyone you are\nvindicated.\u201d 17Then Abraham prayed to God, and\nGod healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife\nand female slaves so that they bore children.", "18For\nthe LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of\nAbimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife. The Birth of Isaac\n21:1 The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and\nthe LORD did to Sarah as he had promised. 2And\nSarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old\nage at the time of which God had spoken to him. 3Abraham called the name of his son who was born\nto him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac.[89] 4And\nAbraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was\neight days old, as God had commanded him.", "5Abraham was a hundred years old when his son\nIsaac was born to him. 6And Sarah said, \u201cGod has\nmade laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh\nover me.\u201d 7And she said, \u201cWho would have said to\nAbraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have\nborne him a son in his old age.\u201d God Protects Hagar and Ishmael\n8And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham\nmade a great feast on the day that Isaac was\nweaned.", "9But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the\nEgyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham,\nlaughing.[90] 10So she said to Abraham, \u201cCast out\nthis slave woman with her son, for the son of this\nslave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.\u201d 11And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on\naccount of his son. 12But God said to Abraham, \u201cBe\nnot displeased because of the boy and because of\nyour slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do\nas she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring\nbe named.", "13And I will make a nation of the son of\nthe slave woman also, because he is your offspring.\u201d 14So Abraham rose early in the morning and took\nbread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar,\nputting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and\nsent her away. And she departed and wandered in\nthe wilderness of Beersheba. 15When the water in the skin was gone, she put the\nchild under one of the bushes. 16Then", "she went and\nsat down opposite him a good way off, about the\ndistance of a bowshot, for she said, \u201cLet me not look\non the death of the child.\u201d And as she sat opposite\nhim, she lifted up her voice and wept. 17And God\nheard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God\ncalled to Hagar from heaven and said to her, \u201cWhat\ntroubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard\nthe voice of the boy where he is. 18Up! Lift up the\nboy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make\nhim into a great nation.\u201d", "19Then God opened her\neyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and\nfilled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. 20And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He\nlived in the wilderness and became an expert with\nthe bow. 21He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and\nhis mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt. A Treaty with Abimelech\n22At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander\nof his army said to Abraham, \u201cGod is with you in all\nthat you do.", "23Now therefore swear to me here by\nGod that you will not deal falsely with me or with my\ndescendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt\nkindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the\nland where you have sojourned.\u201d 24And Abraham\nsaid, \u201cI will swear.\u201d 25When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well\nof water that Abimelech's servants had seized,\n26Abimelech said, \u201cI do not know who has done this\nthing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it\nuntil today.\u201d", "27So Abraham took sheep and oxen and\ngave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a\ncovenant. 28Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the\nflock apart. 29And Abimelech said to Abraham,\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that\nyou have set apart?\u201d 30He said, \u201cThese seven ewe\nlambs you will take from my hand, that this[91] may be\na witness for me that I dug this well.\u201d 31Therefore that\nplace was called Beersheba,[92] because there both\nof them swore an oath. 32So", "they made a covenant\nat Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the\ncommander of his army rose up and returned to the\nland of the Philistines. 33Abraham planted a\ntamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the\nname of the LORD, the Everlasting God. 34And\nAbraham sojourned many days in the land of the\nPhilistines. The Sacrifice of Isaac\n22:1 After these things God tested Abraham and\nsaid to him, \u201cAbraham!\u201d", "And he said, \u201cHere am I.\u201d\n2He said, \u201cTake your son, your only son Isaac, whom\nyou love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him\nthere as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of\nwhich I shall tell you.\u201d 3So Abraham rose early in the\nmorning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his\nyoung men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut\nthe wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to\nthe place of which God had told him.", "4On the third\nday Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place\nfrom afar. 5Then Abraham said to his young men,\n\u201cStay here with the donkey; I and the boy[93] will go\nover there and worship and come again to you.\u201d 6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering\nand laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand\nthe fire and the knife.

And Abraham\nwent and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt\noffering instead of his son. 14So", "Abraham called the\nname of that place, \u201cThe LORD will provide\u201d;[94] as it\nis said to this day, \u201cOn the mount of the LORD it shall\nbe provided. \u201d[95]\n15And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a\nsecond time from heaven 16and said, \u201cBy myself I\nhave sworn, declares the LORD, because you have\ndone this and have not withheld your son, your only\nson, 17I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply\nyour offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand\nthat is on the seashore.", "And your offspring shall\npossess the gate of his[96] enemies, 18and in your\noffspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,\nbecause you have obeyed my voice.\u201d 19So Abraham\nreturned to his young men, and they arose and went\ntogether to Beersheba.

In the sight of the sons\nof my people I give it to you.

The name of the older was Leah,\nand the name of the younger was Rachel. 17Leah's\neyes were weak,[125] but Rachel was beautiful in\nform and appearance. 18Jacob loved Rachel. And\nhe said, \u201cI will serve you seven years for your\nyounger daughter Rachel.\u201d 19Laban said, \u201cIt is better\nthat I give her to you than that I should give her to any\nother man; stay with me.\u201d 20So", "Jacob served seven\nyears for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few\ndays because of the love he had for her. 21Then Jacob said to Laban, \u201cGive me my wife that I\nmay go in to her, for my time is completed.\u201d 22So\nLaban gathered together all the people of the place\nand made a feast. 23But in the evening he took his\ndaughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he\nwent in to her. 24(Laban gave[126] his female servant\nZilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)", "25And\nin the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said\nto Laban, \u201cWhat is this you have done to me? Did I\nnot serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you\ndeceived me?\u201d 26Laban said, \u201cIt is not so done in\nour country, to give the younger before the firstborn. 27Complete the week of this one, and we will give\nyou the other also in return for serving me another\nseven years.\u201d 28Jacob did so, and completed her\nweek. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to\nbe his wife.", "29(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah\nto his daughter Rachel to be her servant.) 30So\nJacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel\nmore than Leah, and served Laban for another\nseven years. Jacob's Children\n31When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he\nopened her womb, but Rachel was barren. 32And\nLeah conceived and bore a son, and she called his\nname Reuben,[127] for she said, \u201cBecause the LORD\nhas looked upon my affliction; for now my husband\nwill love me.\u201d", "33She conceived again and bore a\nson, and said, \u201cBecause the LORD has heard that I\nam hated, he has given me this son also.\u201d And she\ncalled his name Simeon.[128] 34Again she conceived\nand bore a son, and said, \u201cNow this time my\nhusband will be attached to me, because I have\nborne him three sons.\u201d Therefore his name was\ncalled Levi.[129] 35And she conceived again and\nbore a son, and said, \u201cThis time I will praise the\nLORD.\u201d Therefore she called his name Judah.[130]\nThen she ceased bearing.", "5And Bilhah conceived\nand bore Jacob a son. 6Then Rachel said, \u201cGod has\njudged me, and has also heard my voice and given\nme a son.\u201d Therefore she called his name Dan.[133]\n7Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore\nJacob a second son. 8Then Rachel said, \u201cWith\nmighty wrestlings[134] I have wrestled with my sister\nand have prevailed.\u201d So she called his name\nNaphtali.[135]\n9When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing\nchildren, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to\nJacob as a wife.", "10Then Leah's servant Zilpah bore\nJacob a son. 11And Leah said, \u201cGood fortune has\ncome!\u201d so she called his name Gad.[136] 12Leah's\nservant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. 13And\nLeah said, \u201cHappy am I! For women have called me\nhappy.\u201d So she called his name Asher.[137]\n14In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and\nfound mandrakes in the field and brought them to his\nmother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, \u201cPlease\ngive me some of your son's mandrakes.\u201d", "15But she\nsaid to her, \u201cIs it a small matter that you have taken\naway my husband? Would you take away my son's\nmandrakes also?\u201d Rachel said, \u201cThen he may lie\nwith you tonight in exchange for your son's\nmandrakes.\u201d 16When Jacob came from the field in\nthe evening, Leah went out to meet him and said,\n\u201cYou must come in to me, for I have hired you with my\nson's mandrakes.\u201d So he lay with her that night. 17And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and\nbore Jacob a fifth son.", "18Leah said, \u201cGod has given\nme my wages because I gave my servant to my\nhusband.\u201d So she called his name Issachar.[138] 19And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a\nsixth son. 20Then Leah said, \u201cGod has endowed me\nwith a good endowment; now my husband will honor\nme, because I have borne him six sons.\u201d So she\ncalled his name Zebulun.[139] 21Afterward she bore a\ndaughter and called her name Dinah. 22Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened\nto her and opened her womb.", "23She conceived and\nbore a son and said, \u201cGod has taken away my\nreproach.\u201d 24And she called his name Joseph,[140]\nsaying, \u201cMay the LORD add to me another son!\u201d\nJacob's Prosperity\n25As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said\nto Laban, \u201cSend me away, that I may go to my own\nhome and country. 26Give me my wives and my\nchildren for whom I have served you, that I may go,\nfor you know the service that I have given you.\u201d", "27But\nLaban said to him, \u201cIf I have found favor in your sight,\nI have learned by divination that[141] the LORD has\nblessed me because of you. 28Name your wages,\nand I will give it.\u201d 29Jacob said to him, \u201cYou yourself\nknow how I have served you, and how your livestock\nhas fared with me. 30For you had little before I came,\nand it has increased abundantly, and the LORD has\nblessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I\nprovide for my own household also?\u201d 31He said,\n\u201cWhat shall I give you?\u201d", "Jacob said, \u201cYou shall not\ngive me anything. If you will do this for me, I will again\npasture your flock and keep it: 32let me pass through\nall your flock today, removing from it every speckled\nand spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the\nspotted and speckled among the goats, and they\nshall be my wages. 33So my honesty will answer for\nme later, when you come to look into my wages with\nyou.", "Every one that is not speckled and spotted\namong the goats and black among the lambs, if\nfound with me, shall be counted stolen.\u201d 34Laban\nsaid, \u201cGood! Let it be as you have said.\u201d 35But that\nday Laban removed the male goats that were\nstriped and spotted, and all the female goats that\nwere speckled and spotted, every one that had white\non it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in\nthe charge of his sons.", "36And he set a distance of\nthree days' journey between himself and Jacob, and\nJacob pastured the rest of Laban's flock. 37Then Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond\nand plane trees, and peeled white streaks in them,\nexposing the white of the sticks. 38He set the sticks\nthat he had peeled in front of the flocks in the\ntroughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks\ncame to drink.", "And since they bred when they came\nto drink, 39the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so\nthe flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and\nspotted. 40And Jacob separated the lambs and set\nthe faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the\nblack in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves\napart and did not put them with Laban's flock.", "41Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding,\nJacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the\neyes of the flock, that they might breed among the\nsticks, 42but for the feebler of the flock he would not\nlay them there. So the feebler would be Laban's, and\nthe stronger Jacob's. 43Thus the man increased\ngreatly and had large flocks, female servants and\nmale servants, and camels and donkeys.", "Jacob Flees from Laban\n31:1 Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were\nsaying, \u201cJacob has taken all that was our father's,\nand from what was our father's he has gained all this\nwealth.\u201d 2And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard\nhim with favor as before. 3Then the LORD said to\nJacob, \u201cReturn to the land of your fathers and to your\nkindred, and I will be with you.\u201d", "4So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the\nfield where his flock was 5and said to them, \u201cI see\nthat your father does not regard me with favor as he\ndid before. But the God of my father has been with\nme. 6You know that I have served your father with all\nmy strength, 7yet your father has cheated me and\nchanged my wages ten times. But God did not\npermit him to harm me.", "8If he said, \u2018The spotted shall\nbe your wages,\u2019 then all the flock bore spotted; and if\nhe said, \u2018The striped shall be your wages,\u2019 then all\nthe flock bore striped. 9Thus God has taken away\nthe livestock of your father and given them to me. 10In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my\neyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated\nwith the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled. 11Then the angel of God said to me in the dream,\n\u2018Jacob,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Here I am!\u2019", "12And he said, \u2018Lift\nup your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the\nflock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for I have\nseen all that Laban is doing to you. 13I am the God of\nBethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow\nto me. Now arise, go out from this land and return to\nthe land of your kindred.\u2019\u201d 14Then Rachel and Leah\nanswered and said to him, \u201cIs there any portion or\ninheritance left to us in our father's house? 15Are we\nnot regarded by him as foreigners?", "For he has sold\nus, and he has indeed devoured our money. 16All the\nwealth that God has taken away from our father\nbelongs to us and to our children. Now then,\nwhatever God has said to you, do.\u201d 17So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on\ncamels. 18He drove away all his livestock, all his\nproperty that he had gained, the livestock in his\npossession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to\ngo to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.", "19Laban\nhad gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her\nfather's household gods. 20And Jacob tricked[142]\nLaban the Aramean, by not telling him that he\nintended to flee. 21He fled with all that he had and\narose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face\ntoward the hill country of Gilead. 22When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob\nhad fled, 23he took his kinsmen with him and\npursued him for seven days and followed close after\nhim into the hill country of Gilead.", "24But God came to\nLaban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to\nhim, \u201cBe careful not to say anything to Jacob, either\ngood or bad.\u201d 25And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had\npitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his\nkinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead. 26And Laban said to Jacob, \u201cWhat have you done,\nthat you have tricked me and driven away my\ndaughters like captives of the sword?", "27Why did you\ng\np\ny\ny\nflee secretly and trick me, and did not tell me, so that\nI might have sent you away with mirth and songs,\nwith tambourine and lyre? 28And why did you not\npermit me to kiss my sons and my daughters\nfarewell? Now you have done foolishly. 29It is in my\npower to do you harm. But the God of your[143] father\nspoke to me last night, saying, \u2018Be careful not to say\nanything to Jacob, either good or bad.\u2019", "30And now\nyou have gone away because you longed greatly for\nyour father's house, but why did you steal my gods?\u201d\n31Jacob answered and said to Laban, \u201cBecause I\nwas afraid, for I thought that you would take your\ndaughters from me by force. 32Anyone with whom\nyou find your gods shall not live. In the presence of\nour kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and\ntake it.\u201d Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had\nstolen them.", "33So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's\ntent and into the tent of the two female servants, but\nhe did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent\nand entered Rachel's. 34Now Rachel had taken the\nhousehold gods and put them in the camel's saddle\nand sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did\nnot find them. 35And she said to her father, \u201cLet not\nmy lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the\nway of women is upon me.\u201d", "So he searched but did\nnot find the household gods. 36Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, \u201cWhat is my offense? What is\nmy sin, that you have hotly pursued me? 37For you\nhave felt through all my goods; what have you found\nof all your household goods? Set it here before my\nkinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide\nbetween us two. 38These twenty years I have been\nwith you.", "Your ewes and your female goats have not\nmiscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your\nflocks. 39What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring\nto you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you\nrequired it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 40There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and\nthe cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. 41These twenty years I have been in your house.", "I\nserved you fourteen years for your two daughters,\nand six years for your flock, and you have changed\nmy wages ten times. 42If the God of my father, the\nGod of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not\nbeen on my side, surely now you would have sent me\naway empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the\nlabor of my hands and rebuked you last night.\u201d 43Then", "Laban answered and said to Jacob, \u201cThe\ndaughters are my daughters, the children are my\nchildren, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see\nis mine. But what can I do this day for these my\ndaughters or for their children whom they have\nborne? 44Come now, let us make a covenant, you\nand I. And let it be a witness between you and me.\u201d 45So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. 46And Jacob said to his kinsmen, \u201cGather stones.\u201d", "And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate\nthere by the heap. 47Laban called it Jegar-\nsahadutha,[144] but Jacob called it Galeed.[145]\n48Laban said, \u201cThis heap is a witness between you\nand me today.\u201d Therefore he named it Galeed, 49and\nMizpah,[146] for he said, \u201cThe LORD watch between\nyou and me, when we are out of one another's sight. 50If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives\nbesides my daughters, although no one is with us,\nsee, God is witness between you and me.\u201d", "51Then Laban said to Jacob, \u201cSee this heap and the\npillar, which I have set between you and me. 52This\nheap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I\nwill not pass over this heap to you, and you will not\npass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm. 53The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the\nGod of their father, judge between us.\u201d So Jacob\nswore by the Fear of his father Isaac, 54and Jacob\noffered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his\nkinsmen to eat bread.", "They ate bread and spent the\nnight in the hill country. 55[147] Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed\nhis grandchildren and his daughters and blessed\nthem. Then Laban departed and returned home. Jacob Fears Esau\n32:1 Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God\nmet him. 2And when Jacob saw them he said, \u201cThis\nis God's camp!\u201d", "So he called the name of that place\nMahanaim.[148]\n3And Jacob sent[149] messengers before him to\nEsau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of\nEdom, 4instructing them, \u201cThus you shall say to my\nlord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, \u2018I have\nsojourned with Laban and stayed until now. 5I have\noxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female\nservants.

He\ndivided the people who were with him, and the flocks\nand herds and camels, into two camps, 8thinking, \u201cIf\nEsau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the\ncamp that is left will escape.\u201d 9And", "Jacob said, \u201cO God of my father Abraham and\nGod of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me,\n\u2018Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may\ndo you good,\u2019 10I am not worthy of the least of all the\ndeeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that\nyou have shown to your servant, for with only my staff\nI crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two\ncamps.", "11Please deliver me from the hand of my\nbrother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he\nmay come and attack me, the mothers with the\nchildren.", "12But you said, \u2018I will surely do you good,\nand make your offspring as the sand of the sea,\nwhich cannot be numbered for multitude.\u2019\u201d\n13So he stayed there that night, and from what he\nhad with him he took a present for his brother Esau,\n14two hundred female goats and twenty male goats,\ntwo hundred ewes and twenty rams, 15thirty milking\ncamels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls,\ntwenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.", "16These he handed over to his servants, every drove\nby itself, and said to his servants, \u201cPass on ahead of\nme and put a space between drove and drove.\u201d\n17He instructed the first, \u201cWhen Esau my brother\nmeets you and asks you, \u2018To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead\nof you?\u2019 18then you shall say, \u2018They belong to your\nservant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord\nEsau. And moreover, he is behind us.\u2019\u201d", "19He\nlikewise instructed the second and the third and all\nwho followed the droves, \u201cYou shall say the same\nthing to Esau when you find him, 20and you shall say,\n\u2018Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.\u2019\u201d For he\nthought, \u201cI may appease him[150] with the present that\ngoes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his\nface. Perhaps he will accept me. \u201d[151] 21So the\npresent passed on ahead of him, and he himself\nstayed that night in the camp.", "Jacob Wrestles with God\n22The same night he arose and took his two wives,\nhis two female servants, and his eleven children,[152]\nand crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 23He took them\nand sent them across the stream, and everything\nelse that he had. 24And Jacob was left alone. And a\nman wrestled with him until the breaking of the day. 25When the man saw that he did not prevail against\nJacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip\nwas put out of joint as he wrestled with him.", "26Then\nhe said, \u201cLet me go, for the day has broken.\u201d But\nJacob said, \u201cI will not let you go unless you bless\nme.\u201d 27And he said to him, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he said, \u201cJacob.\u201d 28Then he said, \u201cYour name\nshall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel,[153] for\nyou have striven with God and with men, and have\nprevailed.\u201d 29Then Jacob asked him, \u201cPlease tell me\nyour name.\u201d But he said, \u201cWhy is it that you ask my\nname?\u201d And there he blessed him. 30So", "Jacob\ncalled the name of the place Peniel,[154] saying, \u201cFor\nI have seen God face to face, and yet my life has\nbeen delivered.\u201d 31The sun rose upon him as he\npassed Penuel, limping because of his hip. 32Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not\neat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket,\nbecause he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the\nsinew of the thigh. Jacob Meets Esau\n33:1", "And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and\nbehold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men\nwith him. So he divided the children among Leah\nand Rachel and the two female servants. 2And he\nput the servants with their children in front, then Leah\nwith her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all. 3He himself went on before them, bowing himself to\nthe ground seven times, until he came near to his\nbrother.", "4But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and\nfell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. 5And\nwhen Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women\nand children, he said, \u201cWho are these with you?\u201d Jacob said, \u201cThe children whom God has graciously\ngiven your servant.\u201d 6Then the servants drew near,\nthey and their children, and bowed down. 7Leah\nlikewise and her children drew near and bowed\ndown. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and\nthey bowed down.", "8Esau said, \u201cWhat do you mean\nby all this company[155] that I met?\u201d Jacob answered,\n\u201cTo find favor in the sight of my lord.\u201d 9But Esau said,\n\u201cI have enough, my brother; keep what you have for\nyourself.\u201d 10Jacob said, \u201cNo, please, if I have found\nfavor in your sight, then accept my present from my\nhand.

As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot\nforth, and the clusters ripened into grapes. 11Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the\ngrapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and\nplaced the cup in Pharaoh's hand.\u201d 12Then Joseph\nsaid to him, \u201cThis is its interpretation: the three\nbranches are three days.", "13In three days Pharaoh\nwill lift up your head and restore you to your office,\nand you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as\nformerly, when you were his cupbearer. 14Only\nremember me, when it is well with you, and please\ndo me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and\nso get me out of this house. 15For I was indeed\nstolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I\nhave done nothing that they should put me into the\npit.\u201d", "16When the chief baker saw that the interpretation\nwas favorable, he said to Joseph, \u201cI also had a\ndream: there were three cake baskets on my head,\n17and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of\nbaked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it\nout of the basket on my head.\u201d 18And Joseph\nanswered and said, \u201cThis is its interpretation: the\nthree baskets are three days. 19In three days\nPharaoh will lift up your head\u2014from you!\u2014and hang\nyou on a tree.", "And the birds will eat the flesh from\nyou.\u201d\n20On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he\nmade a feast for all his servants and lifted up the\nhead of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief\nbaker among his servants. 21He restored the chief\ncupbearer to his position, and he placed the cup in\nPharaoh's hand. 22But he hanged the chief baker, as\nJoseph had interpreted to them. 23Yet the chief\ncupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.", "Joseph Interprets Pharaoh's Dreams\n41:1 After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that\nhe was standing by the Nile, 2and behold, there\ncame up out of the Nile seven cows attractive and\nplump, and they fed in the reed grass. 3And behold,\nseven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the\nNile after them, and stood by the other cows on the\nbank of the Nile. 4And the ugly, thin cows ate up the\nseven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke. 5And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time.", "And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good,\nwere growing on one stalk. 6And behold, after them\nsprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east\nwind. 7And the thin ears swallowed up the seven\nplump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it\nwas a dream. 8So in the morning his spirit was\ntroubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians\nof Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his\ndreams, but there was none who could interpret\nthem to Pharaoh.", "9Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, \u201cI\nremember my offenses today. 10When Pharaoh was\nangry with his servants and put me and the chief\nbaker in custody in the house of the captain of the\nguard, 11we dreamed on the same night, he and I,\neach having a dream with its own interpretation. 12A\nyoung Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the\ncaptain of the guard. When we told him, he\ninterpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation\nto each man according to his dream.", "13And as he\ninterpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to\nmy office, and the baker was hanged.\u201d\n14Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they\nquickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had\nshaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in\nbefore Pharaoh. 15And Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cI\nhave had a dream, and there is no one who can\ninterpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you\nhear a dream you can interpret it.\u201d", "16Joseph\nanswered Pharaoh, \u201cIt is not in me; God will give\nPharaoh a favorable answer. \u201d[181] 17Then Pharaoh\nsaid to Joseph, \u201cBehold, in my dream I was standing\non the banks of the Nile. 18Seven cows, plump and\nattractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed\ngrass. 19Seven other cows came up after them, poor\nand very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all\nthe land of Egypt.", "20And the thin, ugly cows ate up\nthe first seven plump cows, 21but when they had\neaten them no one would have known that they had\neaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the\nbeginning. Then I awoke. 22I also saw in my dream\nseven ears growing on one stalk, full and good. 23Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the\neast wind, sprouted after them, 24and the thin ears\nswallowed up the seven good ears.", "And I told it to\nthe magicians, but there was no one who could\nexplain it to me.\u201d\n25Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, \u201cThe dreams of\nPharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh\nwhat he is about to do. 26The seven good cows are\nseven years, and the seven good ears are seven\nyears; the dreams are one. 27The seven lean and\nugly cows that came up after them are seven years,\nand the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind\nare also seven years of famine.", "28It is as I told\nPharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is\nabout to do. 29There will come seven years of great\nplenty throughout all the land of Egypt, 30but after\nthem there will arise seven years of famine, and all\nthe plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The\nfamine will consume the land, 31and the plenty will be\nunknown in the land by reason of the famine that will\nfollow, for it will be very severe.", "32And the doubling of\nPharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by\nGod, and God will shortly bring it about. 33Now\ntherefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise\nman, and set him over the land of Egypt. 34Let\nPharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land\nand take one-fifth of the produce of the land[182] of\nEgypt during the seven plentiful years.", "35And let\nthem gather all the food of these good years that are\ncoming and store up grain under the authority of\nPharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. 36That food shall be a reserve for the land against\nthe seven years of famine that are to occur in the\nland of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through\nthe famine.\u201d Joseph Rises to Power\n37This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his\nservants.", "38And Pharaoh said to his servants, \u201cCan\nwe find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of\nGod?\u201d[183] 39Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cSince\nGod has shown you all this, there is none so\ndiscerning and wise as you are. 40You shall be over\nmy house, and all my people shall order themselves\nas you command.[184] Only as regards the throne will\nI be greater than you.\u201d 41And Pharaoh said to\nJoseph, \u201cSee, I have set you over all the land of\nEgypt.\u201d 42Then", "Pharaoh took his signet ring from his\nhand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in\ngarments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his\nneck. 43And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, \u201cBow the knee!\u201d[185]\nThus he set him over all the land of Egypt. 44Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, \u201cI am Pharaoh,\nand without your consent no one shall lift up hand or\nfoot in all the land of Egypt.\u201d 45And Pharaoh called\nJoseph's name Zaphenath-paneah.", "And he gave\nhim in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera\npriest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of\nEgypt. 46Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the\nservice of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went\nout from the presence of Pharaoh and went through\nall the land of Egypt. 47During the seven plentiful\nyears the earth produced abundantly, 48and he\ngathered up all the food of these seven years, which\noccurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the\ncities.", "He put in every city the food from the fields\naround it. 49And Joseph stored up grain in great\nabundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased\nto measure it, for it could not be measured. 50Before the year of famine came, two sons were\nborn to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera\npriest of On, bore them to him. 51Joseph called the\nname of the firstborn Manasseh. \u201cFor,\u201d he said, \u201cGod\nhas made me forget all my hardship and all my\nfather's house. \u201d[186]", "What he says to you, do.\u201d\n56So when the famine had spread over all the land,\nJoseph opened all the storehouses[188] and sold to\nthe Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land\nof Egypt. 57Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to\nJoseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe\nover all the earth. Joseph's Brothers Go to Egypt\n42:1 When Jacob learned that there was grain for\nsale in Egypt, he said to his sons, \u201cWhy do you look\nat one another?\u201d", "2And he said, \u201cBehold, I have heard\nthat there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy\ngrain for us there, that we may live and not die.\u201d 3So\nten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in\nEgypt. 4But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's\nbrother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm\nmight happen to him. 5Thus the sons of Israel came\nto buy among the others who came, for the famine\nwas in the land of Canaan. 6Now Joseph was governor over the land.", "He was\nthe one who sold to all the people of the land. And\nJoseph's brothers came and bowed themselves\nbefore him with their faces to the ground. 7Joseph\nsaw his brothers and recognized them, but he\ntreated them like strangers and spoke roughly to\nthem. \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d he said. They\nsaid, \u201cFrom the land of Canaan, to buy food.\u201d 8And\nJoseph recognized his brothers, but they did not\nrecognize him. 9And Joseph remembered the\ndreams that he had dreamed of them.", "And he said\nto them, \u201cYou are spies; you have come to see the\nnakedness of the land.\u201d 10They said to him, \u201cNo, my\nlord, your servants have come to buy food. 11We are\nall sons of one man. We are honest men. Your\nservants have never been spies.\u201d\n12He said to them, \u201cNo, it is the nakedness of the\nland that you have come to see.\u201d", "13And they said,\n\u201cWe, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of\none man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the\nyoungest is this day with our father, and one is no\nmore.\u201d 14But Joseph said to them, \u201cIt is as I said to\nyou. You are spies. 15By this you shall be tested: by\nthe life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place\nunless your youngest brother comes here.", "16Send\none of you, and let him bring your brother, while you\nremain confined, that your words may be tested,\nwhether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of\nPharaoh, surely you are spies.\u201d 17And he put them all\ntogether in custody for three days. 18On the third day Joseph said to them, \u201cDo this and\nyou will live, for I fear God: 19if", "you are honest men,\nlet one of your brothers remain confined where you\nare in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for\nthe famine of your households, 20and bring your\nyoungest brother to me. So your words will be\nverified, and you shall not die.\u201d And they did so.\n21Then they said to one another, \u201cIn truth we are\nguilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the\ndistress of his soul, when he begged us and we did\nnot listen. That is why this distress has come upon\nus.\u201d", "22And Reuben answered them, \u201cDid I not tell you\nnot to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So\nnow there comes a reckoning for his blood.\u201d 23They\ndid not know that Joseph understood them, for there\nwas an interpreter between them. 24Then he turned\naway from them and wept.
